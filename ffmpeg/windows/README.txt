To convert the video to webm format, do the following:

$ preparevideo INPUT.mp4 OUTPUT.webm 2

The third parameter is the zooming ratio. 2 means divide the width/height of the video by 2, so if the input is 1920x1080, the output will be 960x540.
Always make the output video of reasonable size, such as 480x320.
